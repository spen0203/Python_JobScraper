# Python_JobScraper
Job indexing websites have made it easy to find job postings relevant to my field of study. One downside I often find though is the postings skills and requirements often don't match my experiences, this creates lost time that could be better used modifying my resume for applications. Because of this I have decided to create a python scraper that will take my daily job postings and forward the most relevant to me.
