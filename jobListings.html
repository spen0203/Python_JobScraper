   The individuals we are looking for are experienced programmers used to working on distributed systems, preferably in a container-based environment (Kubernetes). They must be self-starters and able to complete and move on to new tasks without day to day supervision.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The team is spread across multiple time zones which further emphasizes the need for the right candidate to be able to solve (diagnose, decide, design, implement) issues without immediate interaction and then course-correct based on out of band reviews/comments. The candidate will be co-located with other team members in the Ottawa office and so will have local interactions and support.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
   The team the candidate will be joining is tasked with working on innovation, with an emphasis on AI/ML and how it can be applied to network management (configuration, operations, security, etc). The candidate will need the ability to understand the concepts, work with the team to develop ideas, and help implement those ideas within a proof of concept and/or demonstation artifact.
