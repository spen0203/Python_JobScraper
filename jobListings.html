 <br/>
 <br/>
 If you've ever watched live television, news, sports, or entertainment, you've seen our products in use. All of the major Hollywood award shows, most professional sports teams, and many of the largest broadcasters in the world use Ross Video technology. Get behind the scenes and learn about what it takes to make live events possible.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 If that resonates, and you’re someone with integrity, commitment, and a strong drive to deliver great products, we’d love to hear from you.

  </li>
  <li>
   Advising and making recommendations to management on matters relating to software development, to provide them with an improved basis for decision making and planning.
  </li>
  <li>
   Working on bugs and issues in preexisting code as the need arises.
  </li>
  <li>
   Acting as an occasional trainer for existing and potential customers on an as required basis.
  </li>
  <li>
   Assisting in training other staff members.
  </li>
 </ul>
 If you have strong C++ coding skills, a degree in Engineering or Computer Science and
 <br/>
 experience designing/developing/testing major features and components without
 <br/>
 major assistance, this role may be just for you. If you are known for your

 <br/>
 who loves to meet project deadlines, please apply! If, on top of all this, you
 <br/>
 have some professional video and embedded development experience, and working

 knowledge of TCP/IP communications in C/C++, then we definitely want to meet
 <br/>
 you.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 We will offer you the opportunity to work with cutting-edge broadcast production
 <br/>
 solutions, and to be part of a passionate &amp; talented team, where your
 <br/>
 contributions will be immediately noticed and there will be great opportunities
 <br/>
 for direct customer exposure.
 <br/>
 <br/>
